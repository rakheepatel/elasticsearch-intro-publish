# Find movies that contain 'batman' in the *overview*

GET movies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "overview": "batman"
    }
  }
}

# Find movies that contain 'batman' OR 'thor' in the *overview*

GET movies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "overview": ["batman", "thor"]
    }
  }
}

# Now only 'Batman' (note the uppercase), can you guess why no movies are returned?

'Batman' does not match any documents using a term query beacuse the *overview* field is analyzed using the [standard analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-standard-analyzer.html), causing the text to be added to the inverted indexed in the lowercase form.
