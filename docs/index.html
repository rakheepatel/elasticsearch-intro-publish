class: center, middle, inverse

## Let's get to it!

---

class: center, middle

![kibana logo](media/kibana-logo.png)

*Should be running at [localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

---

# Getting started

Create an index called books

```
  PUT movies
```

Index our first document

```
PUT movies/movie/1
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Spider-Man: Homecoming",
  "genres": [ "comedy", "action" ]
}
```

Searching

```
GET movies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "spider man"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Getting started

Delete a document

```
DELETE movies/movie/1
```

Delete the index

```
DELETE movies
```

---

# Mappings

Define how a document and it fields are indexed

  - Which string should be tokenized or treated as keywords
  - Field data types (e.g number, dates, geolocations)
  - How text field should be analyzed
  - etc

### Dynamic mappings

  - Allows for indexing documents without previously defining the mappings
  - New fields will be added by indexing new documents
  - It can be disabled

.footnote[[Mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html)]

---

# Mappings

Create a mapping for our example movie document

```
PUT movies
{
  "mappings": {
    "movie": {
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "keyword"
        },
        "title": {
          "type": "text",
          "analyzer": "english"
        },
        "genres": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
---

# Term queries

- Similar to a boolean query
- Query is not analyzed
- A document either matches or not. No score (relevancy) is calculated
- Use with `keyword` type values
- Useful for searching: names, ids, discrete values (e.g movie genres)

Query for documents that contain the word `beer`:

```
GET articles/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "description": "beer"
    }
  }
}

```

.footnote[[Term query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/query-dsl-term-query.html)]

---

# Term queries (Exercises)


### Find movies that contain 'batman' in the *overview*
### Find movies that contain 'batman' OR 'thor' in the *overview*
### Now only 'Batman' (note the uppercase), can you guess why no movies are returned?

---

# Range queries

  - Matches documents with values within the specified range
  - Supports numeric, string, date and ip values (since v6)

  ```
    GET movies/_search
    {
      "query": {
        "range": {
          "rating": {
            "lt": 5
          }
        }
      }
    }'
  ```

.footnote[[Range query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html)]
---

# Range queries (Exercises)

### Find movies with *release_date* between `2016-01-01` and `2016-12-01`

---

# Analyzers

- Specifies how the text will be processed before being added to the inverted index (eg. tokenised, stemming, stop word removal)
- Elasticsearch has several [built-in analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-analyzers.html)
- Specified in the mapping
- Supports custom analysers

You can use the `/_analyze` endpoint to test analyzers

.footnote[[Analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html)]

---

# Analyzers (Exercises)
Try the 'standard', 'whitespace'and 'english' analyzers with:
```
GET /_analyze
{
  "analyzer": "english",
  "text": "Where is that caf√©?"
}
```

Create an analyzer so that the following query returns the sample document

.left-column[
  Query:

  ```
  GET analyzer-test/_search
  {
    "query": {
      "match": {
        "title": "bobs burgers"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
]

.right-column[
  Sample document:

  ```
  PUT analyzer-test/show/1
  {
    "title": "Bob's Burgers!!"
  }
  ```
]

---

# Match queries

- Accepts text/numeric/date values
- Analyses the requested value
- Calculates scores; how relevant is a document for the requested query?
- Supports fuzzyness
- By default uses the analyzer specified in the mappings

Find the most relevant movies to the "war"

```
GET movies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "overview": {
        "query": "war"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

.footnote[[Match queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html)]
---

# Match queries (Exercises)

### Find movies with 'young' AND  'man' in the overview
Hint: use `operator` field

### Add fuzziness so 'young mam' returns the same results
---

# Pharase-match queries

- Analyses the requested value
- Calculates scores
- Does not support fuzzyness
- By default uses the analyzer specified in the mappings


.footnote[[Phrase-match query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query-phrase.html)]
---

# Pharase-match queries (Exercises)

### Find only movies that contain the phrase 'young man' (in that order)


### What happens if the analyzer removes the stopwords? Would `match_phrase` still work?
---

# Bool queries (query composition)

Combine the results and scores of multiple queries

Possible contexts:
  - `must`: The clause must appear in matching documents and will contribute to the score.
  - `must_not` & `filter`: Executed as filters, only matching documents will be returned and no scores are calculated.
  - `should`: The document "should" match the clause
    - If it is in a context that has `must` or `filter` it will be used to influence the score, not to filter. Documents might be returned even if they do not match any of the `should` clauses
    - If it is by itself, will behave as an *OR*; documents must match at least one of the `should` clauses

.footnote[[Bool queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-bool-query.html)]
---

# Bool queries (Example)

```
GET movies/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": {
        "match": {
          "title": "thor"
        }
      },
      "must_not": {
        "match": {
          "title": "ragnarok"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
---

# Bool queries (Exercises)

### Find movies that contain 'comedy' and do NOT 'action' in the *genres*

### To the previous query, add a clause to filter AND rank by the relevance of 'life' in the *overview* field
HINT: Look at ` must`

### Find ALL the 'comedy' movies and boost those that are about 'christmas'
